Welcome to the my project, the Personalized File Manager. As you can probably tell my program is still in its infancy as it is plauged with shit code and unlimited functionality issues. The language I've decided to use if you haven't look at the mess that is my source code will be Python but I'm currently in the process of switching over to Cython to have the benefit of both C and Python. 

Listed below will be functionality to be added or functionality that's already added to the source code:
1) Global searches for any file.
2) File creation and manipulation. 
3) File conversion and compression. 
  I.e. .wav --> .mp3, .doc --> .pdf, etc. 
4) User friendly to all no matter of technical literacy for both Windows, Linux, and Mac users.

Hopefully I can make these four generalized functions possible with due time. Thank you for checking it out and if you'd like to flame me for garbage practices my email is listed: Nathaniel.Marcum@Gmail.com
